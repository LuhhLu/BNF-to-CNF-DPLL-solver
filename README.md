# BNF-to-CNF-DPLL-solver
This project implements a Sudoku solver using the DPLL (Davis–Putnam–Logemann–Loveland) algorithm. It can parse Sudoku puzzles provided via command-line inputs or from a BNF (Backus–Naur Form) input file. The solver converts Sudoku constraints into CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form) clauses and then applies the DPLL algorithm to find a solution.
